	* Unit Testing Framework
		* Basically the standard in PHP Unit Testing Frameworks

	* What is Unit Testing
		* Unit Testing is testing individual units of code (ie single method/function) to verify it works the way you want it to today, it works the way you expect it to in the future and it doesn't get broken down the road
		* If you aren't unit testing you should be, it makes your life so much better
		* Unit Testing is supposed to test things in isolation as much as possible (further explain down the road) but basically we want to test just the method not the dependencies
	* Why should we unit test

	* exceptedException
3. Slightly more Complex Case
	* Some more complex examples of tests
5. Mocking Objects with Mockery
	* PHPUnit Mocking is ok, but we can do better
6. Code Coverage
